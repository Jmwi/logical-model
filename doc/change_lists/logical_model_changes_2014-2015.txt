General Comments: 


* We should go back to using “unique”, because ‘primary key’ is a relational database concept, and this could be implemented in ways other than a relational database, and unique is more general 


* Put BaseMetaData and MetaData always at the bottom, since developers may scan for that/expect it there.


* Store model in the github repository, then previous versions can’t be lost and won’t need to be recovered


* Sometimes we use StatusDate and other times DateOfStatus


* WorkplacePromiseDifference in EntryRHY has a typo in Logical Model (extra “i”)
